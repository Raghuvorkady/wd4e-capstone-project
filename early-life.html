                Narendra Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati
                Hindu family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay
                State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children
                born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915–1989) and
                Hiraben Modi (born c. 1920). Modi's family belonged to the
                Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community, which is
                categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian
                government.

                As a child, Modi helped his father sell tea at the Vadnagar
                railway station, and said that he later ran a tea stall with his
                brother near a bus terminus. Modi completed his higher
                secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher
                described him as an average student and a keen debater, with
                interest in theatre.[26] Modi had an early gift for rhetoric in
                debates, and his teachers and students noted this. Modi
                preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical
                productions, which has influenced his political image.</p>

                When eight years old, Modi discovered the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending
its local shakhas (training sessions). There, Modi met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, popularly known as
Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) in the RSS and became his
political mentor. While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and
Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who were founding members of the BJP's Gujarat
unit in 1980.

Also in Narendra Modi's childhood, in a custom traditional to his caste, his family arranged a
betrothal to a girl, Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, leading to their marriage when they were
teenagers. Sometime thereafter, he abandoned the further marital obligations implicit in the
custom, and left home, the couple going on to lead separate lives, neither marrying again, and the
marriage itself remaining unmentioned in Modi's public pronouncements for many decades. In
April 2014, shortly before the national elections that swept him to power, Modi publicly affirmed that
he was married and his spouse was Jashodaben; the couple has remained married, but estranged.

                Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India, though few
details of where he went have emerged. In interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams
founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in
Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. Modi remained only a short time at each, since he
lacked the required college education.Vivekananda has been described as a large influence
in Modi's life.

In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the Belur Math but was turned away, after which Modi
wandered through Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati. Modi
then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before travelling back
to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968–69. Sometime in late 1969 or early 1970, Modi
returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad. There, Modi lived with
his uncle, working in the latter's canteen at the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.

               In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar
Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city. After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he stopped
working for his uncle and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS, working under
Inamdar. Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested; this has been cited as a reason for Inamdar
electing to mentor him. Many years later Modi would co-author a biography of Inamdar,
published in 2001.

In 1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from School of Open Learning at University of Delhi, graduating with a third class. Five years later, in 1983, he received a
Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat University, graduating with a first class
as an external distance learning student.
